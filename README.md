# Computer Vision Homeworks
This is all six homeworks for the Computer Vision course taught by Assistant Professor Pengshuai Wang in the fall term of 2023 at PKU. And the final team project is in repo [https://github.com/Wanderings0/Neural-Texture-Synthesis](https://github.com/Wanderings0/Neural-Texture-Synthesis)
### HW1
About image filtering and subsampling, camera parameters.
### HW2
About image stitching and panorama.
### HW3
About epipolar geometry, including foundamental matrix estimation, camera calibration and triangulation.
### HW4
About binocular stereo, depth map.
### HW5
About Neural Network basics. For some reason, code was lost.
### HW6
